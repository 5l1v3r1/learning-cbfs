This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the examples found in 

A. Robey, H. Hu, L. Lindemann, H. Zhang, D. V. Dimarogonas, S. Tu, and N. Matni, [Learning Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03315)

- The code needed to replicate the planar example of Section 4.0.1 is found in the notebook planar-example.ipynb.
- The code needed to replicate the airplane example of Section 4.0.2 is found in the folder airplane_example
- For those interested in generating their own training data, we have included the airplane simulator in the Sim folder: please see the Readme in that folder for further instructions!
